<h2>About Me</h2>

<h2>
	As a software enthusiast with a passion for coding, I am committed to developing my career as a software engineer and software developer. In June, I will complete a Data Science bootcamp where I am gaining valuable knowledge and practical experience in the most popular programming language, Python, as well as scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, and more. I have learned the essentials of probability and statistics for data analysis and visualization and understand the fundamental concepts of machine learning.<br>
<br>
With a Bachelor of Computer Science degree from the University of West London, which I will complete in February 2024, and a range of IT certifications, including a Foundation Certificate in Cyber Security and Microsoft 365, I am equipped with the necessary technical skills to excel in a software development role. I am proficient in programming languages such as Agile, Java, JavaScript, React JS, Node, HTML, CSS, and SQL and have hands-on experience troubleshooting and installing software on PCs, laptops, and printers.
<br>
<br>
Currently, I work as a Service Operations Analyst at CUBE, where I have gained valuable experience in providing 1st and 2nd line technical support, testing company software, and coordinating with external support desks to resolve issues. Along with my technical skills, I possess strong customer service skills and can effectively meet the needs of customers while achieving targets. I am a team player and can work collaboratively with others while managing my time effectively. My analytical and critical thinking skills allow me to approach problems logically and systematically.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can make a positive impact at your company.
