	<h2> During my time at university, I have learned about complexity theory, which is a branch of computer science that deals with the study of the complexity of algorithms and their performance. One of the key concepts in complexity theory is time complexity, which refers to the amount of time required for an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. This is typically measured using big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm.

		Another important concept in complexity theory is space complexity, which refers to the amount of memory required for an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. Space complexity is also typically measured using big O notation and is an important consideration when designing algorithms for use in resource-constrained environments.
		
		Through my studies, I have gained an understanding of the various techniques used to analyze time and space complexity, including worst-case analysis, average-case analysis, and amortized analysis. I have also learned about various classes of algorithms and their corresponding time and space complexities, such as polynomial time algorithms, exponential time algorithms, and logarithmic space algorithms.
		
		Overall, my study of complexity theory has provided me with a deep understanding of the trade-offs involved in designing algorithms for various applications, and has equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to develop efficient and effective algorithms in a range of contexts. </h2>
